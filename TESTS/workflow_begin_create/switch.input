!Note A: "1" means ON (This is usually the correct switch), "0" means off.
!Note B: idipole_x, idipole_y
!        Worry about following two cases later 
!        interaction = 9                         ! y-dipole
!        interaction = 10                        ! x-dipole
!      - they are needed for IR stuff, so we set them to "0".
!Note C: ibcna, ibcxc
!        If you set igauss3C = 1 in itheory.input, there is NO NEED to 
!        calculate 3C-NA and 3C-XC. So ibcna and ibcxc are IRRELEVANT.
!Note D: isnuxc1c, isnuxc2c
!        The spin-polarization option is currently implemented only for 
!        the LSDA-VWN exchange correlation model.
