# If you want to do a KS Calculation
# copi de param for KS:
cp readparam_KS.f90  ../../../progs/READFILES/readparam.f90

# we need to do that because there are some options must be when the fdata were reading
# for example idipole=1, iks=1, idogs=imcweda=0

# compile the library libf2py:

cd ../../../progs/
# Makefile : MACHINE = ILINUX_fast05.static
# create libf2py.a libpyfb*so

make libf2py
# use test with Fdata
# 1                 idipole_z         ! dipole (two-center)
# 1                 idipole_y         ! dipole (two-center), Note B
# 1                 idipole_x         ! dipole (two-center), Note B
# i.e. idipole=1 

./test2KS.py


# test2.py and test.py worked with McWeda,
# However doesn't works because we changed how the options was readed
# to do KS works in py and in libf2py.f90 f2py_deallocate_all
