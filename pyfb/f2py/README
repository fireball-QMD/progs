# If you want to do a KS Calculation
# copi de param for KS:
cp readparam_KS.f90  ../../../progs/READFILES/readparam.f90

# we need to do that because there are some options must be when the fdata were reading
# for example idipole=1, iks=1, idogs=imcweda=0

# compile the library libf2py:

cd ../../../progs/
# Makefile : MACHINE = ILINUX_fast05.static
# create libf2py.a libpyfb*so

make libf2py
# test
cd TESTS/relax/
./start.py
